Being able to search for information in your notes is great but being able to query your notes for specific answers is even better.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is good because it supports markdown, but most importantly it keeps your notes private.

Notion is a similar tool but is cloud-based. Although less private, this means it can more easily offer tools such as Notion Q&A, which allows you to ask questions, or "chat", about your notes. The downside is that your data is shared with companies such as Open AI and Anthropic to achieve this.

## What if you could have both
Obsidian supports 3rd party plugins, one of which is the "Smart Second Brain". This plugin allows Obsidian to interface with a tool called [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Ollama works locally as a wrapper around many Large Language Models (LLMs) giving you a standard interface to use them. By combining both these tools we're able to process our Obsidian notes using LLMs locally without the data leaving our computer.
